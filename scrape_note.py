# In web Scraping a lot of error can be found so we have to handle all this error using try and except blocks

#urlopen('url')  this is used to make a particular url accesscible to our code to allow us to get the requiered information for it

#if the link is assigned with a variable-html it can get all the html code onto our terminal using html.read()
#BeautifulSoup(html.read(), 'external_help') BS can now be used to get specific data with ext help like lxml,html.parser, html5lib to help format our data that is going to be extracted

#if bs was the variable holding ðŸ‘† we can get the result of what we scraped by ðŸ‘‡ it would get all the values that has the h1 tag which is usually the title
'''
bs.body.html
bs.h1
bs.html.h1

# HTTPError and URLError are 2 main error that deals with httprequests
#URLError pops up when the url opened isnt found, while HTTPError just arises if the server returned a bad request
